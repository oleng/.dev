# .dev
Sick of manually setting up configs & forgetting preferred setups for one machine to another.   
Stolen & borrowed shamelessly from many, mostly herrbischoff/awesome-macos-command-line & donnemartin/dev-setup

This repo is for automating development setups on new installs (or resetting to default configurations & environments), including dotfiles.
